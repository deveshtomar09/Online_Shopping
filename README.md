# Online_Shopping
This C++ program uses four different classes to simulate an online shopping system. The program starts with defining two structs, namely, Product and Cart, which represent products and the shopping cart. The program also defines three functions, namely, displayProducts(), addToCart(), and displayCart(), which are responsible for displaying a list of products, adding products to the cart, and displaying the shopping cart, respectively.
